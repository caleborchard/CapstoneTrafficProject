# CMIS202 Capstone Project: High-Speed Rail and Bus Transportation Simulation

## Project Overview
This Java-based simulation models a high-speed rail and bus transportation network using queueing theory. It demonstrates how passengers flow through a multi-modal transit system and evaluates system performance under different loads and configurations.

## Features
- Distribution of worker departures and destinations based on real census data from the DC area, and can be quickly modified via a configuration file.
- Lorem Ipsum blah blah blah, add more here.
